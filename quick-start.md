To make our first request, weâ€™ll need to authenticate first. Our Nextzen AMS API Version 1.0 utilizes Auth API Key for the authentication of requests. You can obtain and manage your Auth API Key from Nextzen AMS API Portal.

**Example Auth API Key: \[**ZHdfv6GYuNq0sezBpQ**â€¦.]**

Nextzen AMS API Version 1.0 utilizes response codes to indicate successful and failed API requests.
